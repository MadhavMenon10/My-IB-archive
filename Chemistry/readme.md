# Chemistry IA
My IA was on the iodination of propan-2-one. At the time of writing this, I do not know the score my IA received but I was predicted somewhere in the 20s/24. I did get a 7 in chemistry so my IA couldn't have been that bad.

# Disclaimer
There may be changes to IA criteria or IA format as there was a syllabus change from 2024 to 2025. Keep this in mind as you read my IA as mine conforms to the 2024 syllabus.
