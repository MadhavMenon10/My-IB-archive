# English IO
My IO was centred around the global issue: The impact of the stigmatisation of the lower class of society on their socioeconomic progress. The field of enquiry was "politics, power, and justice". My literary text was _Small Fry_ by Anton Chekhov and my non-literary text was the movie _Parasite_ by Bong Joon-Ho.

In my mock IO I received a 30/40 and was told my actual IO was better than my mock. I was two marks away from a 7 in English so I'm assuming my IO scored pretty decently.
