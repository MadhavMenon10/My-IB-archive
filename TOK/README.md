# TOK
TOK was the IB component I did the worst on by a mile. I was originally predicted an A but ended up obtaining a C with a 13/30 overall (I needed 3 more marks to increase to a B according to the May 2024 grade boundaries). 

I was marked a 7/10 on my exhibition but this was eventually moderated to a 5/10. I received a 4/10 on my essay.

My essay pulled my score down as it was extremely rushed due to internal deadlines (in fact I did not even have time to proofread my essay, you'll likely notice a pretty big grammatical error in the very first paragraph that likely set my examiner off from the get-go). 

Thus, I would use both my exhibition and essay as a guide of what **not** to do.
