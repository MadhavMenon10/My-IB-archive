# Economics SL IA
My economics portfolio focused on indirect taxation of demerit goods, contractionary monetary policy and cost-push inflation, and the removal of import tariffs. At the time of writing this I do not know how much I scored on my IA but I received a very high 7 in economics and was told that my IA was excellent, so it could not have scored that bad. As I did economics SL, none of my commentaries contain HL only concepts.

# Disclaimer on RWEs and important tip for paper one preparartion
At the time of creating my RWE document (towards the start of exams), I knew that I would not be picking the global economy question in paper one as it was the section of the syllabus I found the hardest. As you only need RWEs for paper one and can choose between the micro, macro, or global economy question I already knew that I only needed to know RWEs for micro and macro. This is why my RWE doc only contains micro and macro.

Furthermore, only topics with the "AO3" learning objective in the subject guide can come as a 15 marker in paper one. Thus, only topics that come under AO3 require RWEs. This will help you keep track of all the concepts you may need RWEs for.

# Flashcards
Since economics requires you to be able to draw a handful of graphs and recall some advantages and disadvantages at times, I found using flashcards and actively drawing graphs using pencil and paper to be far more productive than passively reading the textbook. Some of these flashcards may be incomplete as I made these towards the start of the exam session. As I took economics SL, I do not have any flashcards for HL only content.
