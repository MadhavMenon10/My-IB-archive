# My EE
I did my extended essay in mathematics. I was originally predicted a D on my EE which eventually got bumped up to a C and finally a B for my last set of predicted grades. My EE eventually received a B with a score of 25/34 (2 points away from an A according to the May 2024 grade boundaries).

If you ask the math department about my extended essay journey, they will likely laugh. My entire EE process was extremely shaky, causing me to procrastinate on it until January of IB2 (which is when I did the bulk of my work on it). I originally set out to do a Physics EE and had the bulk of my research done and experiment planned out during IB1. Unfortunately, the school did not have the equipment I needed for my experiment so I was partnered up with a local college that allowed me access to their labs. Unfortunately, I was informed a week before I started my experiment that the specs of the equipment available did not match the one I needed. Thus, I decided to change my EE subject to mathematics altogether during the summer as I could not be bothered conducting an experiment anymore. I decided to more or less focus on the same topic but instead explore the mathematical side of it.

You can see how my research focus shifted over time in my RPPF.

# Disclaimer
The attached RPPF does not contain supervisor comments as you are not allowed to see those. Thus, I added the final RPPF which I submitted to the math department, post which the supervisor comments were added.

On a similar note, you are likely going to write your RPPF reflections in a separate doc before you copy-paste it onto the template provided to you by your supervisor. Keep in mind that the formatting may change and certain characters may not render. In my case, the "em dash" did not render and thus you may see certain words not separated by an appropriate space or dash. I did not notice this until I uploaded my RPPF onto this github repo so you should probably proofread your RPPF after copy-pasting it into the template.
