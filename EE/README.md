# My EE
I did my extended essay in mathematics on the topic of numerical methods and differential equations. My EE focuses on the accuracy of Euler's method in approximating the solution to a first-order inhomogenous differential equation

I was originally predicted a D on my EE which eventually got bumped up to a C and finally a B for my last set of predicted grades. My EE eventually received a B with a score of 25/34 (2 points away from an A according to the May 2024 grade boundaries).
