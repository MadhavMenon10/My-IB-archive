# My-IB-stuff
An archive of all my IBDP graded components. **For KC students only.**

## DISCLAIMER: Do **NOT** plagiarise any of my work. 

These documents have been submitted to IB and are therefore in their database. If you plagiarise anything, you risk getting your diploma cancelled. Furthermore, the teachers already have a copy of these too so I wouldn't copy experimental (or otherwise) data, research questions, or anything else for that matter. Instead, I would use these for inspiration and as a guide on what to (and what not to) do for your IAs, EE, and TOK.

## README
The IBDP is arguably one of the hardest curriculums a student can expose themselves to. One of the most frustrating aspects of the IB (aside from the intense workload) is the vague and qualitative marking criteria for every component. It is often difficult to self-evaluate whether your EE or your IA meets every single descriptor in the "top" markband. Thus, I would often resort to looking at high-scoring exemplars as a guide to follow. However, most of these tend to be locked behind a paywall or are restricted to students of a certain school. I personally think that a database with every single KC IA, EE, TOK exhibition and TOK essay should be created so that students have access to a wide array of exemplars, are less likely to plagiarise, and have a solid source of inspiration. Nevertheless, this has not been implemented so I think it would be worth sharing my work.

Please keep in mind that my work is not perfect, there are students who have even better work and there will be students with better work. I believe in the ethos of "free knowledge for everyone" and thus am sharing my work in the spirit of transparency.
