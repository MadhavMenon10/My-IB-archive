# Hello World
Hi, my name is Madhav Menon! I graduated from the IBDP in 2024 with an overall score of 43/45. Currently, I am majoring in Computer Science and Physics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. This archive contains all my IAs, EE, and TOK submissions. All the work here is my own, and all sources used have been properly cited.
